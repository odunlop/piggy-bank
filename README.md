# Piggy Bank Challenge
## Key Skill: Test Driven Developement (TDD)

## Background
This repository was created to complete a learning exercises of **Week 3** of my Makers Apprenticeship. It focussed on developing my ability to properly plan and carry out unit and feature tests in Ruby.

### **Exercise:** 'Piggy Bank'

The **user stories** given for this exercise:

```
As a user,
So that I can save money
I can put coins in my piggy bank
```

```
As a user,
So that I know whether there are coins in my piggy bank
I can shake it, and it will “cling” if there is money in it
```
```
As a user,
So I can enjoy my hard earned savings
I can break my piggy bank and get back the number or coins that I had put in
```
